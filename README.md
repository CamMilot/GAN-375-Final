## Final project for AI-375 

In this project I followed along to create a GAN with the tensorflow library and trained it on the MINST dataset to generate images that would fool a model trained to determine images in side that dateset.

Due to computational limitations I was not fully able to train the GAN model and had memory limitations around 5-6 epochs
